Channel Organisation
====================

What makes a Channel?
=====================

You should make a channel for:

Distinct Topics
---------------

Make sure your channel topic is distinct. Do not make channels that are close
or identical in topic. A common mistake is making multiple of the same channel
type. It's not straightforward for a member to decide "do I use chat 1 or do I use
chat 2"? Having multiple identical channels works against clarity.

Purposeful
----------

A channel should have a purpose in life. Do not add unnecessary channels just because
you feel they would be neat to have. A good methodology to use for adding channels
is to decide on an initial set, and to stick with that initial set until a certain,
distinct topic of conversation keeps rising up. For example, sysadmining rising up
constantly in a general-purpose channel is a good reason to create a channel for
system administration.

Topical
-------

A channel's topic should be wide enough to host a variety of conversations, but
not so wide to be an "any" channel.

Channel Naming
==============

A channel's name is important for getting members of the server to use channels
correctly and to feel confident they're in the correct channel when chatting.

On-Topic
--------

A channel name should be related to its topic. An unrelated channel name will make
it hard for members to feel like they should be chatting in that channel.

.. container:: flex

   .. container:: do

      .. code-block::

         #recipes

      .. container:: caption

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Have a channel name related to its topic.

   .. container:: dont

      .. code-block::

         #channel-7

      .. container:: caption

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't use a channel name with little relation to its topic.

Self Explanatory
----------------

A channel name should be self explanatory. A member should not need to understand
a community in-joke, niche terminology, or otherwise obscure names to be able to
decide what channel they want to chat in.

.. container:: flex

   .. container:: do

      .. code-block::

         #customization

      .. container:: caption

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Have a straightforward channel name that a newcomer can easily discern
         the channel usage from.

   .. container:: dont

      .. code-block::

         #unix-porn

      .. container:: caption

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't use an channel name that a newcomer will not be able to recognise
         as describing a topic.

Concise
-------

A concise channel name is easy to type, easy to remember, and pleasant to look at.

.. container:: flex

   .. container:: do

      .. code-block::

         #sysadmin

      .. container:: caption

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         A concise channel name makes it quick to read and will fit its entire
         text in sidebars on a wide array of user devices.

   .. container:: dont

      .. code-block::

         #system-administration-chat

      .. container:: caption

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         A concise channel name makes it quick to read and will fit its entire
         text in sidebars on a wide array of user devices.

Non-Thematic
------------

A channel's name is a tool, not a place to put your virtual wallpaper. Flair can
be added in many ways, but making the channel name thematic is not a good way.

A thematic channel name is difficult to associate with its topic, and leaves
members feeling unsure about what channel they should be chatting in.

.. container:: flex

   .. container:: do

      .. code-block::

         #support

      .. container:: caption

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Use a utilitarian channel name instead of a thematic one for clarity.

   .. container:: dont

      .. code-block::

         #man-pages

      .. container:: caption

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         A thematic channel name is hard to associate with its corresponding topic.

Category Naming
===============

Naming a category is very similar to naming a channel.

Category names should be short (no more than one word), nouns (contribution, not contributing),
emoji-free, and non-thematic.

Channel Organisation
====================

Keeping channels well-organised is extremely important to making your server a
pleasant and straightforward place to chat in. For consistency, all guilds
should organise their channels should order their channels like so:

- Welcome Channels
- Rules, Information
- Automated Channels (Modlog, News, GitHub Webhooks)
- General Channels (e.g. a "general" category)
- Secondary Channels (e.g. a specific category such as "support")
- Locked Channels (channels that require a role to access)
- Moderation Channels
