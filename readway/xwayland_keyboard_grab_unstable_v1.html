    <h1>xwayland_keyboard_grab_unstable_v1 <small class="text-muted">protocol</small></h1>

    

    <p class="lead">
        
    This protocol is application-specific to meet the needs of the X11
    protocol through Xwayland. It provides a way for Xwayland to request
    all keyboard events to be forwarded to a surface even when the
    surface does not have keyboard focus.

    In the X11 protocol, a client may request an &#34;active grab&#34; on the
    keyboard. On success, all key events are reported only to the
    grabbing X11 client. For details, see XGrabKeyboard(3).

    The core Wayland protocol does not have a notion of an active
    keyboard grab. When running in Xwayland, X11 applications may
    acquire an active grab inside Xwayland but that cannot be translated
    to the Wayland compositor who may set the input focus to some other
    surface. In doing so, it breaks the X11 client assumption that all
    key events are reported to the grabbing client.

    This protocol specifies a way for Xwayland to request all keyboard
    be directed to the given surface. The protocol does not guarantee
    that the compositor will honor this request and it does not
    prescribe user interfaces on how to handle the respond. For example,
    a compositor may inform the user that all key events are now
    forwarded to the given client surface, or it may ask the user for
    permission to do so.

    Compositors are required to restrict access to this application
    specific protocol to Xwayland alone.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible
    changes may be added together with the corresponding interface
    version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version
    number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the
    interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,
    the &#39;z&#39; prefix and the version number in the protocol and
    interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

	The grab_keyboard request asks for a grab of the keyboard, forcing
	the keyboard focus for the given seat upon the given surface.

	The protocol provides no guarantee that the grab is ever satisfied,
	and does not require the compositor to send an error if the grab
	cannot ever be satisfied. It is thus possible to request a keyboard
	grab that will never be effective.

	The protocol:

	* does not guarantee that the grab itself is applied for a surface,
	  the grab request may be silently ignored by the compositor,
	* does not guarantee that any events are sent to this client even
	  if the grab is applied to a surface,
	* does not guarantee that events sent to this client are exhaustive,
	  a compositor may filter some events for its own consumption,
	* does not guarantee that events sent to this client are continuous,
	  a compositor may change and reroute keyboard events while the grab
	  is nominally active.
